# Installing Capsa

:::info Capsa is made with ease of installation in mind.
You should be able to start setting up Capsa in the morning, and be done before lunch!
:::

So you're ready to install Capsa for your project? Great!

There are a few steps in setting up Capsa. Namely: the web stack, and the Unreal Engine plugin.

We recommend first setting up the web stack, as you need a running Capsa Web Stack to verify that everything is set up correctly on the Unreal Engine side when adding the plugin.

## Web stack installation

There are various ways to set up the web stack. To read the guide on setting up the web stack, see [Installing the Web Stack](./web-stack-installation/index.md).

This guide will help you setting up the web stack and adding an environment that the Unreal Engine plugin can send data to.

## Unreal Engine plugin installation

The Unreal Engine plugin installation is very straight-forward: you add and enable the plugin, set a few configuration values, and Capsa will be installed!

To read the guide on setting up the Unreal Engine plugin, see [Installing Unreal Engine plugin](./unreal-engine-plugin.md).
